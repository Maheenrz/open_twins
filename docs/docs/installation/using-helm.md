# Helm

## Installation
First of all, you have to add ERTIS Research group helm repository to your helm repository list:

```bash
helm repo add ertis https://ertis-research.github.io/Helm-charts/
```

Once done, the next step is installing the chart by executing this line on your terminal (in our case, we will use `opentwins` as release name and `opentwins` as namespace, but you can choose the one that you prefeer). To customize the installation, please refer to [Helm's values](https://github.com/ertis-research/Helm-charts/blob/main/OpenTwins/values.yaml) file.

```bash
helm upgrade --install opentwins ertis/OpenTwins -n opentwins --wait --dependency-update
```

After waiting some time, the installation will be ready for use.


## Lightweight installation
As described in the main page, OpenTwins has it's own lightweight version that aims to run on IoT devices such as Raspberry Pi devices.
To install this versi√≥n, you have to follow the first step in order to add ERTIS repository to your repository list and then install the platform using the command bellow:
```bash
helm install ot ertis/OpenTwins-Lightweight -n opentwins
``` 
In this case connections still need to be made for the platform to work properly.
