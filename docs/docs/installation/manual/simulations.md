# Simulations

## FMI simulations

:::warning

The FMI simulation service is currently being tested. Please be patient, as soon as it is properly tested, the public image will be available on Docker Hub.

:::

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster
- OpenTwins with the components of the essential functionality (monitoring) already installed by Helm or manually
- `kubectl` installed and configured

### Deploy

You can manually deploy the component by creating a Kubernetes deployment resource and service.

Create a YAML file for the deployment with this content:

```yaml title="deployment.yaml"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    name: opentwins-fmi-api
  name: opentwins-fmi-api
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: pod-opentwins-fmi-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: pod-opentwins-fmi-api
      name: opentwins-fmi-api
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: ot-agents
      automountServiceAccountToken: true
      containers:
        - image: ertis/opentwins-fmi-simulator-api-v2:latest
          name: opentwins-fmi-api
          env:
          - name: KUBE_NAMESPACE
            value: 
          - name: INSIDE_CLUSTER
            value: 
          - name: INFLUXDB_HOST
            value: 
          - name: INFLUXDB_TOKEN
            value: 
          - name: INFLUXDB_DB
            value: 
          - name: MINIO_TOKEN
            value: 
          - name: MINIO_URL
            value: 
          - name: MINIO_A_KEY
            value: 
          - name: MINIO_S_KEY
            value: 
          - name: POSTGRE_HOST
            value: 
          - name: POSTGRE_PORT
            value: 
          - name: POSTGRE_DB
            value: 
          - name: POSTGRE_USER
            value: 
          - name: POSTGRE_PASSWORD
            value: 
          - name: BROKER_TYPE
            value: 
          - name: BROKER_IP
            value: 
          - name: BROKER_PORT
            value: 
          - name: BROKER_TOPIC
            value: 
          - name: BROKER_USERNAME
            value: 
          - name: BROKER_PASSWORD
            value: 
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8001
          imagePullPolicy: Always
```

Next, create a YAML file for the service with this content:

```yaml title="service.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: opentwins-fmi-api
spec:
  selector:
    name: pod-opentwins-fmi-api
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - protocol: "TCP"
    port: 8000
    nodePort: <PORT>
    targetPort: 8000

```

Apply the deployment and service using the following commands:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -n opentwins
kubectl apply -f service.yaml -n opentwins
```

To **verify that everything is working correctly**, use the following command to check if the new components are running and ready to use.

```bash
kubectl get all -n opentwins
```
