# Purpose

This platform has been designed to facilitate the development of digital twins and is characterised by the exclusive use of open source components. The aim is to achieve a platform that covers all the functionalities that a digital twin may require, from the most basic ones, such as simply checking its real-time state, to more advanced ones, such as the inclusion of predicted or simulated data or visualisation of 3D models of the twins.

:::danger Take care

This platform is currently under development, so its use in production environments is not recommended at this stage.
