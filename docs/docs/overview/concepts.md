# Concepts

In this section, we will explore in depth the concept of a digital twin as defined by the platform. We will detail the information it can contain, explain the idea of a "digital twin type", and discuss how the composition works.

### Digital twin definition

In the platform, **a digital twin is defined as a replica of a real entity**, whether tangible or not. This replica can be considered as an enhancement to monitoring the entity because, although it is not strictly necessary to be classified as a digital twin, it is beneficial to connect the real data of the entity with those generated by means of mathematical simulations or artificial intelligence. In this way, **the digital twin becomes a central point that integrates all available sources of information on the entity**, facilitating a unified, fast and effective query that promotes decision-making and, therefore, the optimization of the real entity.

### Digital twin content

A digital twin is composed of static and dynamic data. 

+ **Static data.** Information relevant to the digital twin that is expected to remain constant, such as the model, the date of acquisition or the location of the machine we are replicating. 

+ **Dynamic data.** Data that changes over time and that we will record in time series, such as the position of a mobile robot or the values measured by a sensor.

[comment]:<TENGO QUE EXPLICAR AQUI QUE ES UN THING, QUE STATIC ES ATTRIBUTE Y TO LO DE DITTO VAYA. ABAJO TAMBIEN TEMA POLITICAS Y DEMAS.>

For example, consider a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor. Its digital twin, represented in JSON format following the [schema provided by Eclipse Ditto](https://eclipse.dev/ditto/basic-thing.html), would look like this:

```json
{
  "policyId": "example:DHT22",
  "attributes": {
    "location": "Spain"
  },
  "features": {
    "temperature": {
      "properties": {
        "value": null
      }
    },
    "humidity": {
      "properties": {
        "value": null
      }
    }
  }
}
```
