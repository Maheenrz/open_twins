# String and number
This is a very simple example of creating a ONE way digital twin for monitoring a device. In this case, the stored information will be a string and a number, both of them have a timestamp asociated.

To create a digital twin, we must first know the schema used by [Eclipse Ditto](https://eclipse.dev/ditto/index.html) called [Ditto Protocol](https://eclipse.dev/ditto/protocol-overview.html).
