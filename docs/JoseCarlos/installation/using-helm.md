# Installation using Helm

## Requirements

- Container manager:
  - Tested on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [ContainerD](https://containerd.io/).
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/releases/download/):
  - Tested on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/releases/download/) and [K3s](https://k3s.io/).
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) version 16.14 or above.


## Installation
First of all, you have to add Ertis Research group helm repository to your helm repository list:
```bash
helm repo add Ertis https://ertis-research.github.io/Helm-charts/
```

Once done, the next step is installing the chart by executing this line on your terminal (in our case, we will use `ot` as release name and `digitaltwins` as namespace, but you can choose the one that you prefeer):

```bash
helm install ot Ertis/OpenTwins -n digitaltwins
```

After waiting some time, the installation is done, but you still need to configure several conections (we are working on making it automatic) as described on the [wiki](https://ertis-research.github.io/digital-twins-platform/).


## Lightweight installation
As described in the main page, OpenTwins has it's own lightweight version that aims to run on IoT devices such as Raspberry Pi devices.
To install this versi√≥n, you have to follow the first step in order to add Ertis repository to your repository list and then install the platform using the command bellow:
```bash
helm install ot Ertis/OpenTwins-Lightweight -n digitaltwins
``` 
As the previous case, some connections still need to be made for the platform to work properly.
