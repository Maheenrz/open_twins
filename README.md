# OpenTwins - Open source platform for Digital Twins

This platform has been designed to facilitate the development of digital twins and is characterised by the exclusive use of open source components. The aim is to achieve a platform that covers all the functionalities that a digital twin may require, from the most basic ones, such as simply checking its real-time state, to more advanced ones, such as the inclusion of predicted or simulated data.

You can find more information about OpenTwins and its architecture in the [publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166361523001574) below:

This platform is currently **under development**, so its use in production environments is not recommended at this stage.
